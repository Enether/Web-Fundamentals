                They were originally bred to herd as well as guard flocks of sheep.
                And they were often left to their own devices in order to accomplish their assigned tasks. This makes the Briard different
                from those breeds that only guard and those that only herd.
                The breeds that just herd are often smaller in size, agily, and swift of foot.
                Those breeds that just guard are ususally larger and heavier. Briards were used in all types of herding situations,
                having the ability to learn many commands and fulfill the jobs expected of them. The Briard was most commonly used as a farm dog in the more crowded farming valleys of France,
                where row crops were grown. Sheep were allowed to graze the grass strips between crops and Briards were responsible for
                keeping the sheep moving along these strips, and preventing the sheep frmo eating the crops. The Briard moved the sheep daily frmo the farm to the
                graze areas and back again at night.
